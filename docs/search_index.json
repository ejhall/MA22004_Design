Summary: MA22004 will run for 11 weeks (20 SCQF/10 ECTS) requiring approximately 200 hours student effort (or 17.5 hours per week less the examination time). On an average week there will be seven planned teaching and learning activities, detailed below. These include 1 seminar (1 h duration, timetabled, online), 1 workshop (1 hour duration, timetabled, face-to-face), and 1 lab (approx. variable duration, online, asynchronous). The expectation will be that students access and engage with the lecture notes and curated digital content before participating in the seminar. 1.1 Seminar Reading This activity contains an engagement measure. Read Watch Listen 3 hours 1 student Tutor is not available Online Read lecture notes. Collaborate 1 hour 6 students Tutor is not available Online (Pre Seminar) Comment on lecture notes through Persuall (measure engagement by fixed number of questions/answers asked). Investigate 1 hour 1 student Tutor is not available Online (Post Seminar) Understand connections between material by exploring comments and questions and through reflection. 1.2 Preparation: Seminar Investigation Investigate 1 hour 1 student Tutor is not available Online Supplementary online material (curated content). 1.3 Seminar This activity contains both engagement and assessment measures. Produce 10 minutes 1 student Tutor is available Online Seminar quiz (measure attainment based on quiz grade). Discuss 40 minutes 60 students Tutor is available Online Review key points of material with appropriate polling (measure engagement by participation in polling and discussion). Practice 10 minutes 6 students Tutor is available Online Student presentations: either a lab presentation or solutions to the seminar quiz. Students who are not presenting a lab presentation will be expected to provide the presenting group with feedback (through blackboard). 1.4 Computer lab This activity contains both engagement and assessment measures. Read Watch Listen 1 hour and 30 minutes 1 student Tutor is not available Online Read instructions and examples. Practice 2 hours 1 student Tutor is not available Online Practice coding and respond to simple interactive elements that deliver instant feedback (measure engagement by responding to interactive elements). Produce 2 hours 1 student Tutor is not available Online Answer review questions and submit for evaluation (measure attainment based on answers to review questions). 1.5 Preparation: Workshop Practice 2 hours 1 student Tutor is not available Online Attempt workshop problems. 1.6 Workshop (Face-to-face) Collaborate 1 hour 6 students Tutor is available F2F Students discuss problems together in small groups. This could be done using break-out rooms if face-to-face meeting not possible. 1.7 Office Hours Discuss 2 hours 6 students Tutor is available Online Instructor available to answer questions about lab/reading. Typically this will not be one-on-one but small group meetings. Representations of the learning experience Figure 1.1: Breakdown of teaching-learning activity by learning type.

["engagement.html", "2 Engagement and Attainment 2.1 Engagement Plan 2.2 Attainment Plan", " 2 Engagement and Attainment The active learning categorization for each activity is identified in § Learning. 2.1 Engagement Plan There are several points that can be measured to assess engagement, including: Seminar Reading Students will be presented with a new collection of notes weekly using Perusall. Students will be responsible for reading notes posting both questions/comments and responses (collaborative annotation). Student engagement will be tracked in Perusall through quality of discourse. Seminar During seminars, students will be presented with live polls, using either Mentimeter or Itempool, to encourage reflection and discussion. Student engagement will be assessed through participation. Seminar During seminars, students will take turns presenting a lab report or quiz solutions with their workshop groups. This will encourage students to challenge their peer’s analysis. Student engagement will be assessed through participation. Computer Lab Students will be required to respond to questions that will be computer-graded in interactive computer labs. Student engagement will be assessed through quality of responses. 2.2 Attainment Plan Student attainment will be assessed continuously through the evaluation of student produced materials and presentations. These items include: + lab reports, + lab presentation (group), + two midterm examinations (computer graded). The grades of these continuous assessment will offer opportunities for intervention and students will receive The final examination will provide a comprehensive assessment of the whole course. "],
["assessment.html", "3 Assessment 3.1 Examinations 3.2 Assignments", " 3 Assessment The module assessment will be weighted: Assessment Weight Assignments 20% Midterm Exam 1 20% Midterm Exam 2 20% Final Exam 40% Note: This is a modification from the previous split (60% degree exam, 20% two class tests, and 20% coursework). As the students will not be given a revision period, the Final Exam will need to be less cumulative in scope and therefore additional weight will be placed on the Midterm Exams. 3.1 Examinations The Midterm Exams will be computer-assessed and will be 1 hour in scope (compared to the 2 hour Final Exam). These will likely be held in week 4 and week 8. The Final Exam will be a 2 hour hand-written exam. Students will be given one additional hour to scan, code, and upload their manuscripts using Gradescope. This process will be thoroughly discussed and practiced by the students with a dummy exam in advance of a real submission. The Final Exam will be given in the last week of term (i.e., during week 11). 3.2 Assignments The assessed coursework will include 6 lab reports and 1 lab report presentation (group work). "],
